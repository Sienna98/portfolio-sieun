        Hello, my name is Si-eun Lee, a Frontend Developer. <br />
        I started my career in web design and publishing in 2021, and for the
        past four years,
        <br />
        I have systematically expanded my expertise in UI/UX architecture and
        interactive development
        <br />
        by actively adopting the latest frontend technologies such as{" "}
        <span className="relative inline flex-shrink-0 flex-grow-0 basis-auto w-auto">
          <span className="z-10 relative font-semibold">
            React, TypeScript, and Next.js 14.
          </span>
          <span
            className={`absolute bottom-0 left-0 h-[10px] bg-[#baffda] w-full`}
          />
        </span>
        <br />
        With a strong foundation in design and publishing,
        <br /> I have a deep understanding of DOM structure and semantic coding.
        <br />I analyze and optimize rendering strategies in React to deliver
        solutions that enhance the user experience.
